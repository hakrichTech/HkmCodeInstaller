If this is not set then Hkm_code will try guess the protocol, domain and path to your installation. However, you should always configure this explicitly and never rely on auto-guessing, especially in production environments" indexPage="Typically this will be your index.php file, unless you've renamed it to something else. If you are using mod_rewrite to remove the page set this variable so that it is blank" uriProtocol="This item determines which getServer global should be used to retrieve the URI string.  The default setting of 'REQUEST_URI' works for most servers. If your links do not seem to work, try one of the other delicious flavors:" negotiateLocale="If true, the current Request object will automatically determine the language to use based on the value of the Accept-Language header. If false, no automatic detection will be performed." defaultLocale="The Locale roughly represents the language and location that your visitor is viewing the site from. It affects the language strings and other strings (like currency markers, numbers, etc), that your program should run under for this request." supportedLocales="en,fr" appTimezone="The default timezone that will be used in your application to display dates with the date helper, and can be retrieved through app_timezone()" charset="This determines which character set is used by default in various methods that require a character set to be provided. see http://php.net/htmlspecialchars for a list of supported charsets." forceGlobalSecureRequests="If true, this will force every request made to this application to be made via a secure connection (HTTPS). If the incoming request is not secure, the user will be redirected to a secure version of the page and the HTTP Strict Transport Security header will be set" proxyIPs="If your server is behind a reverse proxy, you must whitelist the proxy IP addresses from which Hkm_code should trust headers such as HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR and HTTP_CLIENT_IP in order to properly identify the visitor's IP address. You can use both an array or a comma-separated list of proxy addresses, as well as specifying whole subnets. Here are a few examples: Comma-separated: '10.0.1.200,192.168.5.0/24' Array: ['10.0.1.200', '192.168.5.0/24']"/>
